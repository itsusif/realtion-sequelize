**Sequelize Example: Basic Usage with SQLite**

### Overview

This example demonstrates a simple school management system using Sequelize with SQLite as the database engine. Let's delve into the relationships between the entities without diving into the code.

### Entities and Relationships

1. **School**
   - A `School` represents an educational institution.
   - **Relationships:**
     - Each `School` can have multiple `Classrooms`. This is a one-to-many relationship, meaning one school can have many classrooms, but each classroom belongs to only one school.

2. **Classroom**
   - A `Classroom` represents a physical or virtual space where teaching and learning occur.
   - **Relationships:**
     - Each `Classroom` belongs to one `School`. This relationship establishes a direct link between classrooms and the schools they are associated with.

3. **Student**
   - A `Student` represents an individual enrolled in a school.
   - **Relationships:**
     - Each `Student` belongs to one `Classroom`. This relationship signifies the association between students and the classrooms in which they study.

4. **Subject**
    - A `Subject` represents a specific area of study or course.
    - **Relationships:**
      - A `Subject` can be associated with multiple `Classrooms`. This relationship allows subjects to be taught in multiple classrooms across different schools.

### How Relationships Work

- When a new `School` is created, it can have zero or more associated `Classrooms`. This allows for the management of multiple classrooms under a single school entity.
- Similarly, when a `Classroom` is created, it belongs to one specific `School`. This ensures that each classroom is associated with a particular educational institution.
- When a new `Student` is enrolled, they are assigned to a specific `Classroom`. This association facilitates the organization of students within classrooms, allowing for efficient management and tracking of student data.

### Conclusion

Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing and implementing a functional school management system. Sequelize simplifies the process of defining and managing these relationships within a Node.js environment, offering a powerful ORM solution for working with relational databases like SQLite.
